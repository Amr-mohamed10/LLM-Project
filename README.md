# LLM-Project

This repository contains various files and notebooks related to our work with Language Models (LLM). The primary focus is on dynamic content generation and fine-tuning question answering models.

## Files in This Repository

### 1. Dynamic Content Generation.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the process of generating dynamic content using pre-trained language models. It includes examples and code snippets for generating text based on various prompts.

### 2. Environmental Factors.pdf
This PDF document contains an in-depth analysis of the environmental factors and pollution in Egypt. It covers topics such as:
- The impact of the Nile River on Egypt's ecosystem
- The biodiversity and conservation efforts in Egypt
- Challenges posed by climate change and human activities
- Detailed statistics and descriptions of Egypt's natural landscapes

### 3. FineTuning Q&A.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook focuses on fine-tuning a question-answering model. It includes:
- Steps to preprocess the dataset
- Fine-tuning a model on the SQuAD dataset
- Evaluating the model's performance on custom question-answering tasks

### 4. Pre-Trained Q&A.ipynb
This Jupyter Notebook uses a pre-trained question-answering model to answer questions based on provided text. It includes:
- Loading and using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face's model hub
- Examples of extractive question-answering
- Evaluation of the model's responses to various queries
